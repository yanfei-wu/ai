# Solve N-Queens with Constraint Satisfaction  

![8-queens](./EightQueens.gif) 

In this project, symbolic math library ([`SymPy`](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)) is used to explicitly construct binary constraints and then use Backtracking to solve the N-queens problem. The N-Queens problem is to place N queens on a standard NxN chessboard such that none of the queens are in "check" (i.e., no two queens occupy the same row, column, or diagonal).
